💥Understanding tokens and its types:💥

⏩TOKENS: The smallest unit of programming language which is used to compose instructions is known as tokens.
TYPES OF TOKENS :
➡️Keywords.
➡️identifiers.
➡️Literals / Data / values.

✳️KEYWORDS :
• A predefined words which the java compiler can understand is known as keyword.
• Every keyword in java is associated with a specific task.
• A programmer can’t change the meaning of a keyword (can’t modify the 
associated task).
EXAMPLE :
We have 50+ keywords in java,
class , public , static , void , etc. ,.

💥RULE : Keywords are always written in lower case.

✳️IDENTIFIERS :
The name given to the components of java by the programmer is known as identifiers.
LIST OF COMPONENTS :
• class
• method
• variables
• interface etc…

💥NOTE : A programmer should follow the rules and convention of an identifier.
🌟RULES OF AN IDENTIFIERS :
• Identifiers should never starts with a number.
• Identifiers should not have special characters except _ and $.
• Character space is not allowed in an identifiers.
• We can’t use keyword as an identifiers.

✳️CONVENTIONS :
The coding or industrial standards to be followed by the programmer is known
as convention.

💥NOTE :
• Compiler doesn’t validate the convention , Therefore if conventions is not followed then we won’t get compile time error.
• It is highly recommended to follow the convention.

💠CONVENTION FOR CLASS NAME :
Single word - The first word should be in upper case remaining in lower case. 
Example : Addition , Calculator , Sum , etc…
Multi word – The first character of every word should be in upper case remaining in lower case.
Example : SquareRoot , PowerOfDigit , FactorialOfDigits , etc…

💠CONVENTION FOR METHODS AND VARIABLES NAME :
Single word - Should be in lower case 
Example : addition , subtraction,etc,.
Multi word – First word should be in lowercase remaining words should start with uppercase..
Example : squareRoot , powerOfDigit , factorialOfDigits , etc…

💠CONVENTION FOR CONSTANT VARIABLE :
Single word - Should be in upper case
Example : MAX, MIN, etc
Multi word – Should be in uppercase and each word should be separated by _.
Example : SQUARE_ROOT , POWER_OF_DIGIT, etc…

✳️LITERALS :
• The values or data used in a java program is known as literals.
• The data is generally categorized into two types
1.Primitive values
2.Non primitive values
PRIMITIVE VALUES : Single values data is called as primitive values.
NON PRIMITIVE VALUES : Reference of an object is known as non primitive value (group of data).

💠PRIMITIVE VALUES :
Single value data is called as primitive value.
EXAMPLE :
Number
character 
Boolean.
✅NUMBER LITERALS :
● Integer number literals.
Example : 1 , 4 , 67 , 24 , 35 , etc…
● Floating number literals.
Example : 2.3 , 1.0 , 35.5634 , 23.53 , etc…
✅CHARACTER LITERALS :
• Anything which is enclosed within a single quote ( ‘ ’ ) is considered as a 
character literal.
• The length of character literals should be one.
EXAMPLE : 
‘a’ , ‘G’ . ‘1’ , ‘$’, etc…
✅BOOLEAN LITERALS :
Boolean literals are used to write logical values. We have two Boolean literals
• true
• false

💠NON PRIMITIVE VALUES :
Reference of an object/address is known as non primitive value (group of data).
EXAMPLE : String , details of object , etc…
✅STRING LITERALS :
• Anything enclosed within a double quote ( “ “ ) is known as String literals. The length of the string literals can be anything.
• They are case sensitive.
EXAMPLE : “hello” , “true” , “a” , “123” , “hello@” , “1.1” , etc…
