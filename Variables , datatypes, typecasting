‚è©DATATYPES
‚Ä¢ Datatypes are used to create variables of specific type.
‚Ä¢ In java datatypes are classified into two types.
1. Primitive datatypes
2. Non-primitive datatypes
‚û°Ô∏èPRIMITIVE DATA TYPE :
The data type which is used to create a variable to store primitive value such as numbers, characters, boolean is known as primitive data type.

üí•NOTE : 
¬∞All primitive data types are keyword in java.
¬∞The number data type in increasing order of the capacity.
¬∞byte < short < int < long < float < double

‚û°Ô∏èNON PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE :
The data type which is used to create a non primitive variable to store the reference is known as non primitive data type.

üí•NOTE : Every class name in java is non a primitive dataype.

‚è©VARIABLES :
Variable is a container which is used to store a single value. We have two 
types of variables, they are
‚óè Primitive variable.
‚óè Non-Primitive variable.

‚û°Ô∏èPRIMITIVE VARIABLE :
‚Ä¢ The variable which is used to store a primitive value such as numbers, character, boolean is known as primitive variable.
‚Ä¢ We can create primitive variable with the help of primitive data type.
Syntax to create primitive variable :
datatype identifier1 , identifier2 , ‚Ä¶ ;
primitive datatype identifier1 , identifier2, ‚Ä¶ ;
Example : int a ; ‚Ä¶ ---> primitive variable of int type.
boolean b ; --->primitive variable of boolean type.

‚û°Ô∏èNON PRIMITIVE VARIABLE :
‚Ä¢ The variable which is used to store a reference is known as Non primitive variable.
‚Ä¢ It is also known as reference variable.
Syntax to create a non primitive variable :
Non Primitive datatype identifier1 , identifier2 , ‚Ä¶ ;
EXAMPLE :
String s = new String();

‚è©SCOPE OF A VARIABLE :
‚Ä¢ The visibility of a variable is known as scope of a variable.
‚Ä¢ Based on scope of a variable we can categorize variable in three types.
1. Local variable.
2. Static variable.
3. Non static variable (Instance).

‚úÖLOCAL VARIABLE :
The variable declared inside a method block or any other block except class block is 
known as local variable.
CHARACTERISTICS OF LOCAL VARIABLE :
‚óè We can‚Äôt use local variables without initialization, if we try to use local variable without initialization then we will get compile time error.
‚óè Local variables will not be initialized with default values.
‚óè The scope of the local variable is nested inside the block wherever it is declared, hence it can‚Äôt be used outside the block.

üí†TYPE CASTING :
The process of converting one type of data into another type is known as 
Type casting.
There are two types of type casting :
1) PRIMITIVE TYPE CASTING
1) Widening ( Implicit )
2) Narrowing ( Explicit )
2) NON PRIMITIVE TYPECASTING
1) Upcasting ( Implicit )
2) Downcasting ( Explicit )

‚ú≥Ô∏èPRIMITIVE TYPE CASTING :
The process of converting one primitive value into another primitive value is known as primitive type casting
‚ú≥ WIDENING :
‚óè The process of converting smaller range of primitive data type into larger range of primitive data type is called widening.
‚óè In widening process there is no data loss.
‚óè Since there is no data loss, compiler can implicitly do widening hence it is 
also known as auto widening.
‚ú≥ NARROWING :
‚óè The process of converting larger range of primitive data type into smaller range of primitive data type is known as Narrowing. 
‚óè In narrowing process there is a possibility of data loss.
‚óè Since there is a possibility of data loss, compiler does not do narrowing implicitly .
‚óè It can be done explicitly by the programmer with the help of type cast operator.

‚ú≥Ô∏èTYPECAST OPERATOR :
‚óè It is a unary operator(Only one operand)
‚óè Type cast operator is used to explicitly convert one datatype into another data type.
